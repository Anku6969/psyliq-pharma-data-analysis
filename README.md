# PHARMACEUTICALS DATA ANALYSIS 
In my Data Analyst internship with PSYLIQ, I completed an analysis of pharmacy data using MS Excel and Power BI. Key tasks included filtering and sorting data, summarizing product sales for 2023, and applying conditional formatting to highlight significant sales. I created pivot tables and bar charts to visualize sales by product class and channel. Advanced functions like VLOOKUP, nested IF, and data validation were employed for deeper analysis. In Power BI, I built charts to show sales trends and added slicers for dynamic filtering. The project utilized Excel and Power BIâ€™s capabilities to derive actionable insights from the dataset
